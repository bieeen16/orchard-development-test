          The way ingredients are sourced affects the way we nourish our bodies.
          Author Mark Schatzer believes our body naturally develops an appetite
          for the foods and nutrients it needs to be healthy, but that
          artificial flavourings are getting in the way. this can be reversed by
          focusing on high-quality ingredients and being mindful as your
          appetite guides you to consume accourding to your body's needs

          Sourcing local or organic food is a good way to start being more
          mindful about what you're cooking and eating
